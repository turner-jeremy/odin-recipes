TOP Fundamentals - Recipes Project
This project is from The Odin Project Fundamentals course
So far I have learned HTML boilerplate, and basic html elements including
- Body
- Paragraphs
- Links
- Images
- Lists (Ordered and Unordered)

This project will hopefully put what I have learnt so far to use.
